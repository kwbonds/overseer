# Bridges

Overseer only submits the results of the tests it executes to a redis queue,
in order to actually inform a human about a failure you need to process the
result-queue, and pass the messages on.

Note that each test `overseer` executes is stateless, so if you have a failing
test the notification will be repeated.

To give a concrete example, assume the following test:

    http://example.com/ must run http

If the remote host is offline _every_ time that overseer executes that
test it will record a fresh failure so if you're using the email bridge
you'll receive a fresh email each time the test is executed.

The following bridges are distributed with `overseer`:

* [webhook-bridge](webhook-bridge/)
    * Submits tests via webhook (see [Kubernetes usage example](/example-kubernetes/overseer-bridge-webhook-n17.yaml)).
* [email-bridge](email-bridge/)
    * Submits test-failures via email, using SMTP server (see [Kubernetes usage example](/example-kubernetes/overseer-bridge-email.optional.yaml)).
* [queue-bridge](email-bridge/)
    * Duplicates test results into different queues, so that they can be sent to different destinations at the same time (e.g. webhook + email) (see [Kubernetes usage example](/example-kubernetes/overseer-bridge-queue.optional.yaml)).
* [sendmail-bridge](sendmail-bridge/)
    * Submits test-failures via sendmail.
        * Test results which succeed are discarded.
* [purppura-bridge](purppura-bridge/)
    * Posts test results to a [purppura](https://github.com/skx/purppura/)-instance.
    * The purppura-bridge keeps local state, so it will ensure that humans are only notified once - even though it itself is updated at the end of every run.
